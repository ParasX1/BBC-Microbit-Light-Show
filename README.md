# Micro:bit Light Show with ARMv7 Assembly

## Project Description

In this project, I've created an engaging light show using the BBC micro:bit, a pocket-sized computer powered by an ARM Cortex-M0 processor. The unique aspect of this project is the use of ARMv7 assembly language to intricately control the micro:bit's LED matrix.

## Features

- **Low-Level Programming:** The project demonstrates a deep understanding of low-level programming by utilizing ARMv7 assembly language to control the micro:bit's LED matrix.

- **Creative Display:** The assembly code orchestrates a mesmerizing display of lights, playing with colors, patterns, and transitions.

- **Technical Showcase:** The project highlights the adaptability of the micro:bit's ARM Cortex-M0 processor for advanced projects beyond its typical use in introductory programming education.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Connect your micro:bit to your computer.
3. Write the ARMv7 assembly code in the designated file.
4. Assemble and download the code to the micro:bit.
5. Witness the captivating light show unfold.

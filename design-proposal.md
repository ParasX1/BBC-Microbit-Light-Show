Visual Led Light Show Description:
    Design 1:
        The Idea of my light show is many patternes that interlap,
        The first pattern is possiblely (Im not sure how it should start)
        a X shape which has a delay in creation.
        {
            1 0 0 0 1
            0 1 0 1 0
            0 0 1 0 0
            0 1 0 1 0
            1 0 0 0 1
            Delay as it gets made
        }
        The second shape would also created in a similar fashion,
        it was in the shape of a square.
        {
            1 1 1 1 1
            1 0 0 0 1
            1 0 0 0 1
            1 0 0 0 1
            1 1 1 1 1
            Delay as it gets made kinda like a snake pattern.
        }
        The third shape would also created in a similar fashion,
        it was in the shape of a square.
        {
            0 0 0 0 0
            0 1 1 1 0
            0 1 0 1 0
            0 1 1 1 0
            0 0 0 0 0
            Delay as it gets made kinda like a snake pattern.
        }The fourth shape would also created in a similar fashion,
        it was in the shape of a square.
        {
            1 1 1 1 1
            1 0 0 0 1
            1 0 0 0 1
            1 0 0 0 1
            1 1 1 1 1
            Delay as it gets made kinda like a snake pattern.
        }
        The Idea above if I chose to go with it, will encompass many 
        more shapes and significantly more designs.(SO THE SHAPES ABOVE 
        ARE A VERY MINIMAL AMMOUNT OF SHAPES, THE ASSIGNMENT WILL CONTAIN 
        MANY MORE AS I NEED MORE THAN 30 seconds worth)

    Design 2:
        Apart from this idea, i have another Idea for programming sections
        of lights in a branch, which would allow for quick calling turning
        on and off of the lights. Theorectically this will be less customisable
        but will allow for a more complex sys0 0 0
           
            1 0 0 0 0
            0 0 0 0 0
            0 0 0 0 0
            0 0 0 0 0
            Delay as it gets made
        }
        Another example of 1 "Section"
        {
            0 0 1 0 0
            0 0 1 0 0
            0 0 0 0 0
            0 0 0 0 0
            0 0 0 0 0
            Delay as it gets made
        }
        There are many methods of inplementing sections, I will have to play 
        arround with other leds to try and find the best combination witch 
        allows for maximum utility.
    
Creation Method:
    Design 1:
        If design 1 is chosen to be done, it will most likely be constucted
        with large shape led sequences pre-programmed, which then will be
        called in a main loop. To maximise effiency and ammount of physical
        resources used will be minimal.
    Design 2:
        If design 2 is chosen, it will likely be completed using many more 
        smaller loops in comparison to the method of construction of design 1.
        The construction may involve maybe a numerous ammount of smaller loops.
